# NURBS Surface Renderer

This project is an OpenGL application that demonstrates the rendering of a NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) surface using the GLU library. It showcases how to define control points, knots, and other properties essential for NURBS surface creation and visualization.

## Features

- **NURBS Surface Rendering**: Uses GLU library functions to render a NURBS surface defined by control points.
- **Interactive View**: Allows rotation and scaling transformations to view the surface from different perspectives.
- **Customizable Surface Properties**: Demonstrates how to adjust properties such as sampling tolerance and display mode.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:
- An OpenGL-compatible graphics card.
- GLUT and GLU libraries installed on your system.
