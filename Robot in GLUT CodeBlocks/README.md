# Robot OpenGL Project

This project is an OpenGL application that renders a simple robot using basic 3D graphics primitives provided by the GLUT library. The robot is composed of a body, a head, eyes, and limbs, each created with transformations to display the robot in a visually appealing way.

## Features

- **3D Robot Rendering**: Displays a robot with a body, head, eyes, and limbs.
- **Interactive Camera**: Utilizes `gluLookAt` for camera positioning to view the robot from different angles.
- **Lighting Effects**: Includes basic lighting to enhance the 3D effect.
- **Dynamic Resizing**: Handles window resizing without distorting the robot proportions.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:
- An OpenGL-compatible graphics card.
- The GLUT library for handling the windowing and user input.
